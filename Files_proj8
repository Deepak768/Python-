7.2 Write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:
X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values and produce an output as shown below. 
Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.
You can download the sample data at http://www.py4e.com/code3/mbox-short.txt when you are testing below enter mbox-short.txt as the file name.

z=0
count =0
fname = input("Enter file name: ") 
fh = open(fname)   //opens the file 
#x=fh.strip()
for line in fh: //goes line by  line 
    if not line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:") : continue  //if what we are searching is not in the line, it will ptint
    #print(line)
    for ele in line: 
        x=line.find(':')  //finds ":"
        host=line[x+1:]  //from the line get the stuff starting with ":" and keep going through of the index
        count+=1
        y=float(host)
        z+=y  //taking the sum 
        avg=z/count  //doing the average
        #print(count,'countis')
    #print(host)
print('Average spam confidence:',avg)  //prints
#print("Done")
