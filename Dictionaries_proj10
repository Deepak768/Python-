9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages.
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail.
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file.
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

count=dict()
name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt" #it's a default  if the len is <1
handle = open(name)

for line in handle:
    word = line.split()
    if line.startswith('From '):
        count[word[1]] = count.get(word[1], 0) + 1  #prints histogram-prints the key and value
#print(count)

bigcount=None  #current largest count we have seen thus far or nothing yet
bigword=None
for key,value in count.items():
    if bigcount is None or value>bigcount: #this will go into to dict and look for value that bigger than the presiding one and prints out the largest one
        bigword=key  #or the count we have just read is greater than the previous one
        bigcount=value
print(bigword,bigcount)
