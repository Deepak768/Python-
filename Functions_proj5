4.6 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. 
Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. 
The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). 
You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless
you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.


def computepay(h,r):
    ##print("compute pay",h,r)

    if h>40:
        pay=1.5*r*(h-40)
        pay2= r*(40)
        p=pay+pay2
    ##    print("overtime",p)
    elif h<40:
        p=r*h
    #print("returing",p)
    return p




hrs = input("enter hours:")
rate= input("rate")
h=float(hrs)
r=float(rate)
print( computepay(h,r))

#print("pay:",xp)
